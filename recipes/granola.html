    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Fantastic bars that have a lot of flexibility. 
        You can adapt the recipe to your liking. 
        Great for hikes, long road trips and camping as they store well and keep fairly long - unless you eat them all! 
        Use any combination of chocolate chips, dried fruit, coconut, pecans, almond slices, or any other tidbits you'd like in a granola bar.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups quick-cooking oats</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 cup flaked coconut</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced almonds</li>
        <li>1 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sweetened dried cranberries</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the oats, sweetened condensed milk, butter, coconut, almonds, chocolate chips and cranberries with your hands until well blended. Press flat into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, depending on how crunchy you want them. Lightly browned just around the edges will give you moist, chewy bars.</li>
        <li>Let cool for 5 minutes, cut into squares then let cool completely before serving</li>
    </ol>
